Welcome to Bamazon.
Here is a video illustrating a common user experience https://youtu.be/rIeo5CTKj44

This application will be making use of node.js and mySQL.

The app will be used in the Terminal where a user can select from a list of Items that are for sale.
The initial running of the js file will result in a list of said items along with their item number, price, department, and remaining quantity

Once shown the list you will be prompted to select your item using is item ID.

If there are enough of said item you will be given a final price for your selection and asked if you want to continue shopping.

If the item stock is too low for your selection there will be a message warning you of the lack of quanitity and you will be redirected to the selection stage of the app.

Please enjoy this high class shopping experience, also don't go too crazy as we are keeping track of users and will collect on the debt.
